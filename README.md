# project-template-for-replication
Near-empty template directory to aid project replicability

Use this file README.md to walk a newcomer through setting up the project and finding the right code to run. For example,* 

* System configuration: the file `environment` contains a Python virtual environment. Activate it by installing `[...]` and then running `[...]`.

* Raw data is in `data/raw/`. Intermediate data files are in `data/[...]` and `data/[...]`, respectively.

* Main results (model output and figures) are in `results/`.

* The file `code/cmds.sh` runs all code.

OR

* Under `code/`, the subdirectory `[...]` does `[...]`, and the subdirectory `[...]` does `[...]`. Each subdirectory has a file `cmds.sh` which reproduces its results.

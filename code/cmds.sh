# This file should record the end-to-end commands that change the raw data into intermediate data and then into results.
#
# -Most likely a set of commands that can be run either at a python or R prompt, or at a command-line (bash) shell.  
# (Please specify, and change the file extension to .py or .R if appropriate.)
#
# -If code is stored in a notebook, this file could indicate the notebook's filename and the line numbers to execute.
#
# -If there are many steps (probably!), this file could point to the files for each step (in order) and tell how to execute them.
#
# -If some processing was done manually, this file should still describe the input and output files and how the transformation was done.
